$ t
You're not working on anything.
You finished "#{last_task}" at 3:23pm (12 minutes ago)

add filtering:
  -e PATTERN, --regexp=PATTERN
  t --list --from "one week ago" -e "@work"

items that start in one day and end in another are logged with a date string and stored in the file they started in => solution: store full date string in CSV (timezones and everything)

t --list should show the current task (with an indicator that it's ongoing)
